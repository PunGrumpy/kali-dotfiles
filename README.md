## `📦` Installation

> **Warning**: Don't AFK while installing this dotfiles. You might miss some important prompts. I recommend you to read the script first before running it. You can also install the dotfiles manually by copying the files to their respective directories. I recommend you to use the script instead. It's easier and faster.
